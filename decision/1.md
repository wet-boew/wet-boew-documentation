How to use SVG image in a web page.

## Summary

* **Design decision number:** 1
* **Expert:** @EricDunsworth
* **Submited:** 2018-02-12
* **Validated:** by @duboisp on 2018-02-12
* **Status:** Approved on 2018-04-19
* **Type:** Markup validation

## Scope

In web content, when using a SVG image.

## Issue

Avoiding a HTML validation error when ```object``` element was used to load SVG image and ```tabindex=-1``` was used to ensure the object element do not receive focus.

## Recommendation

Load the SVG image with an ```img``` elements.
```xml
<img src="{{assets}}/../{{site.theme}}/assets/logo.svg" alt="" />
```

### Deprecated

Use an ```object``` element to load a SVG image. 

### Migration

Replace the SVG loaded with an ```object``` element by an ```img``` element.

#### Example

Should:
```xml
<a href="#"><img src="{{assets}}/../{{site.theme}}/assets/logo.svg" alt="" /></a>
```

Was:
```xml
<a href="#"><object type="image/svg+xml" tabindex="-1" data="{{assets}}/../{{site.theme}}/assets/logo.svg"></object></a>
```


## Test

Run the nu validator on a page that load SVG with ```object[tabindex=-1]``` vs ```img```.

### Nu validation

[wet-boew English home page that use a SVG in the theme header.](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=http%3A%2F%2Fwet-boew.github.io%2Fv4.0-ci%2Findex-en.html)

**Expected result:**

To **not** get the following error:

> Error: An element with the attribute tabindex must not appear as a descendant of the a element.

## Evidence

The wet-boew theme logo are an SVG image and an object element was used to load it.

See: 
* [https://github.com/wet-boew/wet-boew/issues/8276](https://github.com/wet-boew/wet-boew/issues/8276)
* [https://github.com/wet-boew/wet-boew/pull/8282](https://github.com/wet-boew/wet-boew/issues/8276)

### Background

The reason a ```tabindex="-1"``` attribute was used on SVG ```<object>``` elements in the first place was because of #1432 (which was fixed by wet-boew/wet-boew-legacy@cc8b81c). Without that attribute, all browsers attempt to set keyboard tabbing focus inside the ```<object>``` element - which isn't desirable.

### Rational

The validator/validator#422 was resolved. One of the commits that fixed it (validator/validator@1c02bc18e7a71d531fcd62e60b4dc2064c753cef) intentionally caused any elements containing ``tabindex`` attributes to trigger a validation error when situated within ``<a>``/``<button>`` elements.

Based on my research, validator/validator@1c02bc18e7a71d531fcd62e60b4dc2064c753cef's behaviour is in line with the [W3C's HTML spec](https://w3c.github.io/html/):

* Excerpt from the [spec's tabindex section](https://w3c.github.io/html/editing.html#element-attrdef-global-tabindex):
  * "An element with the [tabindex](https://w3c.github.io/html/editing.html#element-attrdef-global-tabindex) attribute specified is [interactive content](https://w3c.github.io/html/dom.html#interactive-content-2)."
* Excerpt from the [spec's interactive content section](https://w3c.github.io/html/dom.html#interactive-content-2):
  * "The [tabindex](https://w3c.github.io/html/editing.html#element-attrdef-global-tabindex) attribute can also make any element into [interactive content](https://w3c.github.io/html/dom.html#interactive-content-2)."
* Excerpt from the [spec's content model section for the ``a`` element](https://w3c.github.io/html/textlevel-semantics.html#elementdef-a):
  * "[**Content model**](https://w3c.github.io/html/dom.html#content-model): [Transparent](https://w3c.github.io/html/dom.html#transparent), but there must be no [interactive content](https://w3c.github.io/html/dom.html#interactive-content-2) or [<a>](https://w3c.github.io/html/textlevel-semantics.html#elementdef-a) element descendants."

So, what does this have to do with WET? It turns out that most of WET 4.0's themes use SVG site logos that are structured as links containing an ``<object>`` element with a ``tabindex="-1"`` attribute. In other words, WET is nesting interactive content (``<object tabindex="-1">``) within other interactive content (``<a>``), which goes against the HTML spec.

As a result, the following error is now appearing when [validating virtually any pages that use WET](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=http%3A%2F%2Fwet-boew.github.io%2Fv4.0-ci%2Findex-en.html):
> **Error:** An element with the attribute tabindex must not appear as a descendant of the ``<a>`` element.
> 
> From line 61, column 1; to line 61, column 83
> 
> ``<object type="image/svg+xml" tabindex="-1" data="./theme-wet-boew/assets/logo.svg">``

IMO the best way of fixing this would be to replace the ``<object>`` element with ``<img>`` in WET's SVG images and remove the ``tabindex="-1"`` attributes. I believe it should work fine in all modern browsers and retain compatibility with the [SVG image replacer polyfill](https://github.com/wet-boew/wet-boew/blob/master/src/polyfills/svg/svg.js).

#### Printing

If you SVG are a white image, then you will need to consider to apply some CSS filter to provide a printable version of it.

Apply a brightness filter to 0 for an ```img``` with only white content. (For more background [https://github.com/wet-boew/wet-boew/pull/8282/files#r167673909](https://github.com/wet-boew/wet-boew/pull/8282/files#r167673909))
```css
img.fltrbr0 {
	filter: brightness( 0 );
}
```
