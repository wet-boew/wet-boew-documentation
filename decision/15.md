## Scope

Coding HTML void elements (self-closing tags) in web content where they should or not have a trailing slash.

## Issue

HTML validation information messages are generated when validating a page which include **void elements** (self-closing tags) and when they are codded using a trailing slash at the end. This doesn’t prevent the page to render properly. There is two schools of thought:
* The first one in favor of leaving out the trailing slash since it's only optional in HTML5, it's not recommended, can conflict with unquoted attribute values and, it generates info messages on validation.
* The second one is in favor of keeping the trailing slash, like in XHTML strict 1.1, because it makes the document more structered (more rigid) and usualy clearer for novice readers (refer to the advantage of Typescript vs pure JS).

## Recommendation

Since trailing slashes are no longer requierd nor recommended for void elements (self-closing tags) in HTML5 and because information messages are reported by W3C HTML5 validation, we are recommending removing trailing slashes for every void elements such as the ```<meta >```, ```<link >```, ```<img>```,```<input>```, ```<hr>``` and other [void elements](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html#void-elements). 

### Migration

Example: Remove the slash at the end of every void elements (self-closing tags) located inside the ```<head>``` section and global footer of every Canada.ca templates.

Should:
```HTML5
<meta charset="utf-8">
<link rel="alternate" hreflang="en" href="https://www.canada.ca/en.html">
<img src="/etc/designs/canada/wet-boew/assets/sig-blk-en.svg" alt="Government of Canada" property="logo">
<input id="wb-srch-q" list="wb-srch-q-ac" class="wb-srch-q form-control" name="q" type="search" value="" size="34" maxlength="170" placeholder="Search Canada.ca">
<hr>
```

Was:
```XHTML
<meta charset="utf-8"/>
<link rel="alternate" hreflang="en" href="https://www.canada.ca/en.html"/>
<img src="/etc/designs/canada/wet-boew/assets/sig-blk-en.svg" alt="Government of Canada" property="logo"/>
<input id="wb-srch-q" list="wb-srch-q-ac" class="wb-srch-q form-control" name="q" type="search" value="" size="34" maxlength="170" placeholder="Search Canada.ca"/>
<hr/>
```

### How to test

Run the [W3 Nu HTML Checker](https://validator.w3.org/nu/) on a Web page where the slashes have been removed from void elements and expect no info warning messages related to trailing slash.

Example: [Canada.ca Home page (English).](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.canada.ca%2Fen.html)

**Expected result:**

To **not** get the following info warning message:

> Info: Trailing slash on void elements [has no effect](https://github.com/validator/validator/wiki/Markup-%C2%BB-Void-elements#trailing-slashes-in-void-element-start-tags-do-not-mark-the-start-tags-as-self-closing) and [interacts badly with unquoted attribute values](https://github.com/validator/validator/wiki/Markup-%C2%BB-Void-elements#trailing-slashes-directly-preceded-by-unquoted-attribute-values).

## Evidences

### Research and findings

* Nu HTML Checker from [The W3C Markup Validation Service](http://validator.w3.org) flags trailing slashes on void elements(self-closing tags) as info warnings. Although there are not restraining the page to render properly, since HTML5, it's strongly recommended to not make use of them anymore.
* [Google HTML/CSS Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html#Document_Type) recommends using self-closing tags (void elements) without any addition of trailing slashes.
* Trailing slash can [interfere with unquoted attributes values](https://github.com/validator/validator/wiki/Markup-%C2%BB-Void-elements#trailing-slashes-directly-preceded-by-unquoted-attribute-values).
* The [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) seems to have a preference of keeping trailing slashes for self-closing tags (void elements) based on the fact that it makes the document structure clearer for novice readers and because the code formatter [Prettier.io](https://prettier.io/) seems to add trailing slashes to self-closing tags (void elements) when cleaning the code, but on another note, they also said that self-closing tags do not exist in HTML.
* The [Code Guide](http://codeguide.co) in its HTML syntax, states to not include a trailing slash in self-closing elements.
* The [GoCardless HTML style guide](https://github.com/gocardless/html-style-guide) doesn’t include a forward-slash on void elements.
* In the [Learn HTML - document structure](https://web.dev/learn/html/document-structure/) section of the [web.dev](https://web.dev/), examples that have void elements (self-closing tags) don’t use the end forward slash.
* As stated in the [MDN Github issue #20523](https://github.com/mdn/content/issues/20523), "Trailing slashes for empty elements seem no longer recommended because they're unnecessary and slow things down".
* Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) wysiwyg clean and remove trailing slashes for void elements (self-closing tags) when rendering pages for Canada.ca. Validation info messages are generated from trailing slahes found in Canada.ca templates.

### With self-closing

The [HTML standard](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html#start-tags) states that you can use a trailing slash in a void-element start tag for literally any purpose except to mark the start tag as self-closing.

The following are all acceptable reasons for using a trailing slash in a [void-element](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html#void-elements) start tag:
* Some users like how it looks.
* Some users run their HTML markup through a formatting tool that’s hardcoded to add trailing slashes to all void-element start tags, without any option for them to prevent the tool from doing that.
* Some users write a lot of JSX code, and JSX requires the trailing slash — without any option for them to prevent JSX from doing that — so for consistency with what they're accustomed to in JSX, they follow that same style in actual HTML documents.

### Without self-closing

When learning about HTML, teaching about HTML, and designing HTML tools, it’s important to have and promote the right mental model about how HTML actually works and the way HTML works is that there’s [a discrete set of void elements](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html#void-elements), hardcoded into HTML parsers, and people who write HTML must learn and remember which elements those are — without any trailing slash needing to be added to those elements to indicate they are special.

The reason a trailing slash was used on void elements (self-closing tags) in the first place was for conforming with XHTML Strict 1.1 markup previously used for CLF2 templates. In HTML5, trailing slashes on void elements (self-closing tags) are now optional and strongly discourage.

## Usage of XML syntax in HTML

Opinions surounding the usage of trailing slash for void elements in HTML are divided going from making the document structure clearer for novice readers, the info messages generated by the HTML5 validator opinion based and have been implemtentaed to have users stop using trailing slashes, HTML specs hasn't changed and some of their code examples are still using slashes and so on. Refering to the [HTML standard 1.8 HTML vs XML syntax](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#html-vs-xhtml), if a document is transmitted with the ```text/html``` MIME type, then it will be processed as an HTML document by web browsers. After a brief investigation, major sites such as: GCWeb, Canada.ca and CRA are all transmitted with the ```text/html``` MIME type. As well, standard 1.8 reminds us that the processing for XML and HTML differs; in particular, even minor syntax errors will prevent a document labeled as XML from being rendered fully, whereas they would be ignored in the HTML syntax. Although common browsers support XML (XHTML) syntax in an HTML declared document, as minimal as it is, it takes some processing time to do the conversion. Therefore, using XML syntax in an HTML document, when the content type is not explexitely set to ```text/xhtml``` is considred an error.
