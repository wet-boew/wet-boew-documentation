Documents created via those meeting will be published on the wet-boew website.



## To participate
* **Technical review meeting:** You can start by making contribution like submitting PR and participating in open issue.

Label color: #e102d8

* Meta

### Need

Identify what is needed to move the issue forward.

Label color: #fbca04

* Need: Analysis / Research - Need to be deep dive to find a solution or perform research.
* Need: Evidence - When there is two opposite idea that conflict, providing evidence for each point of view will help to understand and take a design decision.
* Need: More information - There is not enough information provided in the issue to take an action that would resolve it.
* Need: Record finding - Means that some piece of information described in the issue need to be replicated in the documentation or in the working example. For example, any described test case (test example) should be replicated in the documentation for future reference.
* Need: Replicate issue - Someone, usually different of the issue author, need to replicate the described issue with a fresh independent wet-boew copy in a different environment.
* Need: Second opinion - A solution is provided, but prior to be applied it needs to be backed.
* Need: Tests example - Test name with step by step with a code sample (if needed) then what is the expected results. Code sample and expected result would describe the test state before and after the fix is applied
* Need: Testing - The issue need testing.
* Need: Use case - The usefulness to be more detailed. Defining what is the desired outcome.

### Query

Identify what the issue is about.

Label color: #84b6eb

* Query: Bug
* Query: Feature request
* Query: Question
* Query: Implementation
* Query: News - Historical
* Query: Discussion


### Severity

Identify the importance of the issue compared to the overhaul wet-boew project.

Accessibility issues are classified with an higher severity.

Label color: Each state have their own color.

* Severity: Critical (color: #b60205)
* Severity: Major (color: #FF3300
* Severity: Minor (color: #fef2c0
* Severity: Normal (color: #cccccc)

Note:
* An issue that are not tagged with any severity is know by default being into a normal severity state.
* A major issue can represent an issue that conflict with one or more core principle of the Web Experience Toolkit, like a HTML validation issue, an accessibility issue according to WCAG...
* A minor issue is under the normal severity.
* A critical issue is a WET feature that are fully unusable or when it is noticed and demonstrated that default and recommended configuration of a WET feature would potentially cause an human right issue as defined by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
* Ideally, the solution of a critical issue would respect all WET core principle. But in some case that is not feasible and the solution applied is a mitigation plan and it is required that a longer term plan is created and closely tracked by the project roadmap lead. For example: https://github.com/wet-boew/wet-boew/issues/8238


### State

Identify what state the issue is currently under. Useful when they are open for long period of time or for complex issue.

Label color: #EE8310

* State: Going stale - Historically used to identify a issue that didn't got immediate and active public interest.
* State: Last call - An official deadline is set which the issue are going to be closed if nothing new is presented. Usually this is because a resolution or a decision has been proposed and we are going to assume it is accepted as is.
* State: On hold - Represent an issue that need to be considered for a future major milestone.
* State: Not supported - The issue is about unsupported feature or block of code.
* State: Ready for implementation - Means that the topic was discussed thoroughly and a solution are defined and it's now ready to be implemented.
* State: Resolved - An acceptable solution have been provided and the issue would be closed after a reasonable period of time. After the period, it will be assumed the author has accepted the acceptable solution.
* State: Work in progress - Represent an issue that is currently under active development and progression is reported frequently.
