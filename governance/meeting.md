Summary of what has been discussed at the meeting.

## Roadmap

2019-01-17
Meeting canceled

2018-12-17 (4 participants )
* Briefly showed the last update that are applied to GCWeb and going to be applied to Canada.ca
* WET codefest organising commitee has initiated the planning work for the event. The date and location are not set yet.
* Re-iterated about the versionning number that GCWeb are going to use.

2018-11-15 - ( 6 participants )
* Briefly presented the new major changes that are applied to GCWeb. The list of all changes are published in the [GCWeb theme documentation](http://wet-boew.github.io/themes-dist/GCWeb/gcweb-theme/index.html) and [migration instruction](http://wet-boew.github.io/themes-dist/GCWeb/gcweb-theme/v2-migration.html) are available for implementer.
* For the version number attached with GCWeb release we have discussed the idea of changing how that is done. It was proposed to have a number that are going to reflect the actual changes made to the theme instead of being in the shadow of the release of wet-boew main project. For example the current redesign, name coded "gcweb v2", require major markup change and introduce a completed reviewed menu which would not be aligned anymore with the wet-boew menu plugin. It was suggested to simply rename the repository and then do the release with the revised version number. An issue on the gcweb github repository would be open to get the communauty feedback.
* In the light of deploying the new gcweb look in december, it was suggested to release WET 4.0.30 at the same time. It was noted that is planned in the current roadmap to release WET 4.0.30 for January 17. So, we might only do a "pre-release" of GCWeb in december and in January/February we might release it with the new version number, like v2.0.
* Brief review of all projects, there was no updates except the long documents project has made some progess.
* Codefest - Kick off meeting sent and scheduled for November 20
* We discussed the idea of having the second hours of the WET roadmap reserved to raise awarness on accessibility, openely discuss about web publishing best practice or a presentation how to use WET in a efficient way. A separate invitation would be sent. The target audience are going to be the same as it was for the "Center of Expertise" and web publisher interested in the presented topic. It was suggested the topic are going to be sent two weeks in advance. The idea was well received.

2018-10-18 - ( 5 participants )
* Review of all projects
* As discused at the last meeting, now there is a WET 5 summary page.
* Codefest - Kick off meeting for the planning commitee will be between October 29 - November 2
* Approval of Design Decision #5 - Migration strategy from WET 4 to WET 5
* Redesign of a few components in GCWeb are in progress
* Summarized a discussion that happened during wet-boew technical review about to use figure vs heading structure. Related to [GCWeb #1408](https://github.com/wet-boew/GCWeb/issues/1408) The tehcnical review group were no real preference from a technical stand point, both semantic was fine to list features. It was agree that was more a personal choice of the developer.

* Did a quick demo and overview of WET 5 alpha early prototype
* Discussed and some questions was asked about the current WET 5 approach as demo'ed by the prototype.
	* What would replace the basic HTML mode? Answer: There is no basic HTML mode possible with that design approach.
	* It is know in the communauty the purpose of WET framework is to help web publisher to meet easier the web accessibility guideline. It was noted that:
		* Having a such (WET 5) library, there is a high risk that web publisher could avoid to meet the accessibility requirement in order to meet internal goal, especially with short timeline. Answer: Need to be discussed.
		* More error prone to accessibility error for people with average/low web accessiblity skill. Answer: Need to be discussed.
		* May enforce each team to have their own accessiblity expert. Answer: Need to be discussed.
	* What is the advantage of WET 5 library compared to other library? Answer: Need to be discussed.
	* That library look like to solve a web content managment system (CMS) design issue [1] rather than helping the web publisher to meet web accessibility standard. Answer: Need to be discussed. [1] A CMS like where web publisher can't add any custom JS/CSS code.
	* By using that UI design approach, it may require department to hire more web accessiblity expert. Answer: Need to be discussed.
	* HTML snipped will be provided which it will be recognied to meet the accessibility guideline. But what if there is an update at that snipped? It looks like that may result with more maintenance work for the web publishing team. Answer: Need to be discussed.
* WET 5, as current, related question and discussion will be recorded and managed via a [dedicated research page](/wet-boew-documentation/research/2018-14-wet5-summary.html).

2018-08-24 ( 11 participants )

* Announced that WET 4.0.29 will be released in the following weeks
* The WET 5 presentation was reported to the following week. Details for WET 5 will be published here.

2018-07-26 ( 10 participants )
* Review of all the projects
* Presented an early draft of the first test suites we would have in WET.
	* Heading inside ```<summary>``` element
		* [Temporary live example](https://duboisp.github.io/wet-boew-documentation/assessment/2018-1.html)
		* [Source code](https://github.com/juleskuehn/wet-boew-documentation/tree/detailSummary)
* Presented the new [GCWeb home page](http://wet-boew.github.io/themes-dist/GCWeb/index-en.html)
	* More aligned with the Content and IA spec structure
	* Status label to show the current conformance and backlog items
	* Would be possible to have a detailled history and analysis done for each template. Like the [index pages](http://wet-boew.github.io/themes-dist/GCWeb/index/index.html).
	* Can include departemental specific template. Like [ESDC campaing template](http://wet-boew.github.io/themes-dist/GCWeb/campaign2-en.html)
* WET 5
	* Briefly walked through the work done for the prototype
	* Next WET Roadmap meeting, it will be a presentation of a "functional" WET 5 prototype which should be available to initiate some testing.
	* Will focus on a Data first design approach.
* Test suite and potential future design decision (Best practice)
	* Test suites for heading inside ```<summary>``` element once completed may result by drafting a new Design decision
	* Some work will be intiated to draft a best practice to avoid to use ```placeholder``` attribute. Once the test suites created, tested and the design decision drafted/approved then any CSS customization for the placeholder attribute and related issue about a non-conforming color contrast issue might be close. It's behaviour would be fully delegated to how Browser vendor implement that feature and we will promote and update our working example to not use the ```placeholder``` attribute.

## Special meeting

### WET 5 initial prototype - August 31

[Documenation material presented](../research/2018-11-wet5-augmented-design-presentation.html)

16 participant (8 in person and 8 in teleconference)

Summary
* Presentation of the context of WET 5
* Demonstration of the WET 5 alpha prototype by Mario B.
	* Show what the end user will see
	* Show how interaction pattern are implemented directly in the HTML in-page markup
	* Explained that no build script is required to develop, it use Require.js for dependency loading
	* Explained there is no component, all the logic via a "gear" are configured in the HTML markup
	* Explained the WET 5 loader, which leverage the CSS 3 animation event in order to be trigger.
	* WET 5 web page only support one mode, the standard mode.
	* Explained how a "gear" (a javascript module compatible with the new WET5 architecture) are working
	* Created a new "gear" and it was ready to use upon its creation.
	* Show an enhancer hidden in WET 5 where it highlights area in the web page that are more prone to accessibility error.

Prototype available here: [https://github.com/wet-boew/wet-boew-experimental/tree/release5.0-alpha](https://github.com/wet-boew/wet-boew-experimental/tree/release5.0-alpha)

To setup the prototype you need:
* Download the files and extract it in a Apache HTTP Server. Apache HTTP Server is required to apply the server side include.
* Ensure the HTTP server support the URL rewrite
	* If it don't support Apache Server will return you an error. In that situation, open up the .htaccess file located in "stacks/src" and remove the line that do the URL rewrite.
* The working example is located at: stacks/docs/index.html
* The Javascript file is located at: stacks/src

### WET 5 Kickoff - May 10

[Documentation material presented](../research/2018-3-wet5-kickoff.html)

15 participant (8 in person and 7 in teleconference)

Summary
* The high level concept for WET 5 core was well received.
* It was suggested to switch over ES6 and use thrid party service such Babel to run ES6 on browser that don't support it
* Some concern was express in regards of what the build system could be to support the WET 5 product.
* It was recommended to documents and do more research about the needs from the user of WET.
* Next WET 5 meeting would be more topic specific, like focusing on the core, the build, testing, etc.
* The overall project monitoring will be done through the WET Roadmap meeting.

List of todo:
* Reach out and try to being active on social media.
* Create a page with of thing that need to be addressed and/or taken care of.
* Build small prototype and have it tested with different audience (web developer, web author, WET core developer)
* Produce a documentation that could be easilly aligned with the TBS Digital Standard
* Find contributor across the spectrum and seek their feedback on the product.
* Develop a plan and a strategy to address concern between moving from WET 4 to WET 5.
* Develop a plan and a strategy to address some WET user fears, like removing the jQuery library from WET core.

Suggestion/Idea 
* Use a top bar overlay to advertise the user that he are in the Basic HTML mode
* Having two build system, one for quick local developpement and the full build that may require nodeJS. Some opposition was expressed about having two different type of build.
* Support and promote mobile first design
* Create a business plan about the markup for WET 5, use focus group and explore if it makes senses
* Consider a way to have organisation to lead some WET plugin.
