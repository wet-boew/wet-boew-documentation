**Subject:** There is a list of results, block of content, that are measured by category and filterable by clicking on the meter or/and by clicking on buttons to apply filter by another category.

## Test information

* **Number of participant:** 8 paticipants [6 desktop, 1 mobile (Windows surface)]
* **Participant diversity:** Public servant with varying levels of experience with governement
* **Tested period:** October 28 and October 27, 2017
* **Used in public period:** January 2018 to March 2018
* **Other remark:**
	* Usability test round 1 result.
	* Test as during approximately 20 minutes per participant.
	* Test subjects kept trying when "real" users would give up

## Wireframe tested

### Technical implementation notes
The results, as showed in the bottom of the screen capture, was showing more information when the user click on the expand/collapsae link illustrated with the arrow.

The data was loaded from an external JSON file.

Each meter for the category A was also a link to apply filter.

Between the displayed result and the filtering options, there is a tag cloud allowing to remove a previously applied filter.

## Task results

* Filtering by [category A] was the common way people looked for things - when [category A] are ambiguous this is likely to fail.
* People don't know they're on a filter - searches will fail
* Throughout the test, only 3 clearly understood how to reset the filters (1 mobiles, 1 by refreshing page, 1 by clicking X filters)
* Filtering by [category A] works well, and the related statuses are clear in dektop and mobile... As long as the subject fits into one [category B]
* Ambiguous [category B] are a problem
* [Category B] banner probably looks like an add (banner blindness)
* [Category A] label are successful
* It's hard to pick relevant information out of these description (result item description)

### List of recommendation

* Either:
	* make it more clear that searches are limited by filters; or
	* make it so searches span the entire set
* Filtering must be clearer
* Better labels - for [category A]
* Clearer filter reset
* Clearer text describing the result items, heading, bullets, paragraphs etc.
* Reconsider design of [Category B] banner
* Result item should explain why they have the [category A] they do
* Rewrite the result items content using web writing principles


## Findings

### Filters don't appear to affect display

* Good: People did clearly understand that the [category A] numbers reflected number of result items in a clicked [category B]
* Critical:  No indication that changes here affect the displayed result items. Some people figured it out, but it took time.
* Recommendation: Ensure that there's some way for people to know the result items displayed have changed.

### Whath out for false floors!

Context: Desktop view with a descriptive box of [category B] between [category B] and result items

* Major: When the bottom of teh screen look like the bottom of a page, people don't know there's more bellow. Everyone eventually went bellow, but best to avoid this friction when possible.
* Recommendation: Revise design to ensure continued text appears on typical screen sizes.

### Search isn't apparent

* Major: Search would have been the best way to solve many task. Only 4 people used the search box.
* Recommentation: Make search more apparent

### Issue found

* Critical: Everyone tried to use the [category B] buttons to finds a result item - often guessing wrong. The [category B] are very appealing as a filter but they don't function well.
* Recommendation: Use more standard filtering controls

### Reset filters

* Critical: Only 1 person clicked the close button in the tag cloud. 1 figured out page refresh reset. If this isn't apparent, people will miss [result item], not understant [category A].
* Recommendation: Revise the [category B] filtering mechanism to use commonly understood functionality

### Hard to pick out relevant information

* Critical: Wall-of-test style display makes it hard to pick out points (and goes against Canada.ca Content Style Guide)
* Recommendation: Revise the description of the result itme by using web writing principles. Separate sections for Why.

* Minor: Link to "learn more" at the end of a result item seemed out of place
* Recommendation: Find another way to link to more information aobut [category B]

### Information hidden behind details/summary

* Critical: Some users navigate with find in page (ctrl+f). They will not find information hidden behing details/summary
* Recommendation: Remove the details/summary

### Filter [category A] flags were very successful

### Results layout - simpler?

* Recommendation: Consider simpler default layout - maybe just title? Or maybe display everything? Remove "Learn more link..." Various design possiblities.

### Layout issue - smaller screens or bigger fonts.

The [category B] that span on multiple row and kept in 3 column do not reflow well when the items in the columns are not in the same height.

The effect is:
* We got a button that is split between column 1 and column 2
* There is a white space at the bottom of the third columns

### Mobile layout - pretty clean

### Other issue (but not found in usability test)

Several Style guide issues
* [result item] and [category B] title shouldn't be in title case.
* "Click to view" - many people cannot click (mobile and assistive technology)
* "Result anticipated" followed by a line of text, which when clicked reveals more details - non-standard use of this pattern which is unpredictable

## Proposed improved wireframe

* Remove the button for applying the filter for the Category B
* Put in the left side of the result, a filter didicated section.
* Keep only one coded user interface for mobile view and desktop view
* Move the free text filter, in the top of filter area instead of just before the results.

### Notes:

* Used in production since March 2018

That new layout has been used like that since March 2018, (consider today as end of June 2018) and we received a lot of positive feedback. The subject matter expert that sponser the content with that layout seems to be happy with the design and with it's effiviency for their audience.
