# Module first methodology
WET5 Module first methodoloy explores a more modular approach to the development of features and functionality. Its main difference from the Function first approach is that the focus of the implementation is on clean abstracted functions instead of singleton style functions that pollenate the HTML.

## Benefits
This approach is focused for the following development differences;

* Easier re-use of existing code base offering potentially no code for new function(s) and/or feature(s)
* Increased modularization
* Focused on DRY Principles
* More HTML data-attribute
* Decreased data-option paramaters
