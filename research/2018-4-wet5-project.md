## List of todo:

## Suggestion/Idea 
* Use a top bar overlay to advertise the user that he are in the Basic HTML mode
* Having two build system, one for quick local developpement and the full build that may require nodeJS. Some opposition was expressed about having two different type of build.
* Support and promote mobile first design
* Create a business plan about the markup for WET 5, use focus group and explore if it makes senses
* Consider a way to have organisation to lead some WET plugin.
